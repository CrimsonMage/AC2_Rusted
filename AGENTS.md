# AC2_Rusted Agent Rules

`ARCHITECTURE.md` is the ownership map: every crate is named after the Asheron's Call 2 client
subsystem it reproduces. This file states the working rules.

- `docs/retail-catalog/` lists every retail function by owning crate; it is the work list. Port
  from the decompile (not from Vitaeum-AC2), then mark the catalog with
  `scripts/retail_catalog.py mark done|partial|skip …` in the same commit.
- Behaviour follows the original AC2 client. Cite the class and function a change reproduces
  (`CTransition::step_down`, `FrillRender::RefreshFrillMesh`). Never commit decompiled code,
  game data or data-derived fixtures.
- Where admin 7148 and Legions 7160 differ, follow Legions (the DVD client the DATs ship with):
  read `decompiled-pdb/legions7160/source_tree/` beside the admin tree and note the difference.
- Numeric fidelity: retail ran x87 at 53-bit precision (`_setdefaultprecision`, and
  `D3DCREATE_FPU_PRESERVE` on every `CreateDevice`), rounding to f32 only when storing into
  `float` memory. Evaluate multi-operation expressions in f64 (scalar or f64 SIMD lanes) and round
  to f32 where retail stores a `float`; f32 SIMD is exact only for a single operation between f32
  values stored straight back. Keep hot loops SIMD-friendly (struct-of-arrays, no per-element
  branching) without dropping below that precision.
- New code goes in the crate that owns that AC2 subsystem. If no crate fits, revise
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` first.
- The dependency graph is one-way in the order `ARCHITECTURE.md` lists.
- Every `.rs` file stays under 800 lines; split by responsibility.
- Keep public APIs small: plain data and narrow entry points.
- Tests that need game data read `AC2_DAT_DIR` and are skipped when it is unset.
- `crates/` is the client. `tools/` holds test tooling only; the world viewer is an offline
  harness and never connects to a server.
- Close-out reports list `Retail Behavior traced:`, `Verification:` and `Known Gaps:`.
